# Trivia Game for Streamers

This is a project to create an interactive trivia game for streamers sharing their screen.

Live streaming is about bringing your audience in with fun and new interactions. This allows the streamer to open a trivia game to their audience.

The audience joins via a QR code or URL, allowing them to use a "second screen" experience. The streamer has a community view that displays the trivia questions and answers, and extra stuff from the audience.

The trivia game is setup that people can join in the middle of a trivia session, leaving nobody out even if they join mid-stream.

The interactions are kept clean, so no need for moderation.

## Tech Stack
